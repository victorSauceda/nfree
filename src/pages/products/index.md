#   description: >
#     We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
#     That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
#     journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
#     optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
