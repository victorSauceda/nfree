Listen to what Kimothy has to say while serving his sentence...

Over the years, I've been paying attention to what's going on in the world, as well as what's going on around me... during my observation, I've come to the conclusion that a lot of our thinking and mental mind states are in critical condition.

A lot of men believe that the measure of a man is defined by how skillful they are in acts of war or how tough they are... not realizing that neither anger nor violence constitutes the essence of man.

Other people think that material things and/or how much money they have made them better than other people who don't have them. When in all actuality, your character, morals, and values are what define you.

Some of our friendships and relationships are on life support. It's time to start feeding and nurturing those friendships and relationships with quality substance and sustenance. Today..... make a conscious decision to be a blessing to the people in your life... those blessings will come back to you.
