Today was a great day in my history. We officially launched ðŸŒ±[Thrive SBC](https://www.thrivesbc.com/) to the Santa Barbara County justice impacted community. We have been working on this purposeful application since last October. I am thankful for Code for America, Santa Barbara County Public Defenders Office, Gaucho Underground Scholars, Timothy Malstead, Jeanmarie Levy, Filsan Abikar, Stephen T. Simpson, and Hashim Mteuzi, PMP for making a vision into a reality. It has been an amazing journey. Thrive SBC is an empowering resource tool for Santa Barbara County but is so much more than that. And that was shown at our Formerly Incarcerated Student Day and Resource Fair at UCSB with over 70 people in attendance today for Thrive SBC's initial release. Wanted to share this with my LinkedIn justice impacted community to encourage local community events and resource tools like Thrive SBC to continue to empower others in our communities.
