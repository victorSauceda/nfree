Since I started working out almost 30 years ago, I always thought about how great it would be to train others...I'm one of those people that when I am interested in something I put All my energy into, and try to learn the science behind it, not only how it works, but Why!? (probably my ADD )And with Health and Wellness, that's a long journey! I was expelled from Jr high and then dropped out of high school, I spent my young life loaded and running with a crew of hoodlums and gangsters...I've been in prison for 15 years with no real skills to speak of..until this! This is my passion, I love to work out and help others! What do they say...if you love your job, you never spend a day at work...something to that effect!
Well, I now have a trade and have been reading and acquiring the skills to be the best at it for years!
I'm so excited and anxious to be out and build My brand! The possibilities and opportunities are limitless! And I'm Ready!! I would've never followed through with this had I stayed in the life... We can achieve what we believe!!
