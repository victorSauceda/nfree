The New Freedom Program is the only peer based gang intervention and life skills devlopment class in the Washington State Department Of Corrections. The program was founded by six incarcerated men who are all former gang members, a classification counselor and a correctional lieutenant at the Twin Rivers Unit of Monroe Correctional Complex. The New Freedom Program seeks to remove barriers to success by focusing on the learning of new behavioral skills, Specialized Reentry planning, connection to comprehensive wrap around services, and building a network of support and accountability within the community.
