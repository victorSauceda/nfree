        Meet Victor: My name is Victor Martinez. I’m currently seventeen years into a twenty-eight year sentence, twenty-five years for Washington State D.O.C and three years for Federal prison. From the age of twelve years old I have lived my life as a criminal. I was a gang member, a drug dealer and finally an addict.  That lifestyle was like living in the gutter and lying to yourself every day. Today, I strive to be a positive influence to everyone around me and create an atmosphere where I am able to encourage positive change in others.

        Meet Randy: Arriving to prison at 19 years old in 2004, I was very susceptible to social influences. I quickly became a prison gang affiliate and for the first turbulent years of my time I caused myself many hardships by living in that pit of hopelessness and misery. I am now a gang interventionist - New Freedom peer facilitator, and a hopeful, productive member of my community. It takes many moving parts to power the engines of change, and I am proud to be doing my part to help others change their criminal thinking and trade their gang culture and lifestyle for a more hopeful and promising way of being. I am from Thurston County and my current release date is 02/22/2029

        Meet Kyle: I once heard the expression, "We accept the love we think we deserve." This could apply to any number of dysfunctional relationship types, but in the context of gangs it is especially poignant.
        I have been in prison for over three decades and like everyone else I know who has gone through this carceral experience, I lost everything when I made those impulsive, catastrophic decisions in 1989. The devastating outcomes led to my own imprisonment and loss of worldly possessions, freedom, relationships, privacy, and personal dignity. This void was filled with the only thing available - the pseudo love of a prison gang, the camaraderie of criminals.
        My mission with New Freedom is to replace this false love with real and meaningful pro-social and positive alternatives for gang involved youth and adults alike. This epiphany has become my life's work.

        Meet James: My name is James Paulk. I am 42 years old and from The Dalles, Oregon. I’ve been in prison the last 14 years, most of it spent alone and hopeless. All of my life, I only saw the differences between myself and others. I now feel hopeful and united with like minded individuals from all walks of life. I am able to see the similarities now, that all humans share no matter race, religion or financial position or background. I believe in New Freedom, my team, and the people this program has and will help given the opportunity.

        Meet Daniel: My name is Daniel Perez, I am 24 years old and was born in Yakima Washington. My environment brought gang violence and crime. When my brother passed in 2009 I decided to cope with my grief by turning towards the camaraderie of gang lifestyle and using violence as an outlet. I came to prison at the age of 15 with a 20 year sentence, I then directed my life towards transformation. I accepted my ability to connect with people and be a teacher in order to pursue my purpose in life! I am a gang/criminal interventionist with New Freedom. Through the program I assist men seeking positive change while continuing to develop my own skill set.

        Meet Vu: My name is Viet Vu, I am 47 years old I’ve spent the last 33 years of my life, in and out of prison, because of gang, criminal lifestyle and bad decision. I no longer want to live that lifestyle, and have done all I can to change my life. Through New Freedom I want to help who ever I can, so that they don’t walk down the same road I've walk.

        Meet Kimothy: Hello World,

        I will start by saying that my name is Kimothy Wynn. I'm 43 years old and am currently incarcerated at the Monroe Correctional Complex.

        I'm a former HillTop Crip from Tacoma Washington.

        My new passion in life is to help men get out of gangs. A lot of them just need a positive example they can relate to, someone that's also relatable to them. Someone that won't give up on them if they make a mistake. That's where New Freedom Washington comes in.
        I'm proud to say that I'm a New Freedom Graduate and New Freedom Facilitator. I'm now a published author of two books.
