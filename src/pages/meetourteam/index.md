        Meet Jerry: My name is Jerry Munoz Duran, Sr. I grew up in a home full of anger and abuse, which led me to believe that life was that way for everyone. My lack of knowledge and immaturity guided me into selfishness and lack of compassion as that is all I ever received from my parents and the community I lived in. That is when I found the world of gangs. I became a member of the 18th Street Gang in Franklin County.
        In 1992, I assaulted a man who threatened and insulted my best friend, Mikel DeLeon, another 18th Street member. I served five years in juvenile detention for the assault and was released in March 1997.
        In early June 1997, Mikel decided he wanted to leave the 18th Street Gang and become a youth pastor. This angered many gang members--especially me. who was heard to say, 'that mother fucker wants out, after I did five years for him.' Late at night on June 7, the 18th Street Gang had a party on the banks of the Snake River. Most of the members were there, drinking, smoking marijuana and taking other illicit drugs. Eventually the subject of Mikel's decision to leave the gang came up. Traditionally, members were 'courted out' of the gang, meaning gang members beat on the departing member for 18 seconds. As Mikel prepared to leave the party that night, I demanded 18 seconds. Mikel stepped up to fight, but as another gang member rushed him, I lunged in stabbing Mikel in the chest. Mikel screamed and yelled, 'Why did you stab me? He shanked me.' Some of the gang helped him into a van and rushed him to the hospital. Because the knife had plunged through a rib and into the right chamber of his heart, Mikel was dead upon arrival at the emergency room.
        I was convicted of first-degree murder with a deadly weapon enhancement and he received an exceptional sentence upward. In my case, the trial court heard the arguments of the parties in a pretrial hearing and found that my prior conviction for a gang related assault was relevant to the issue of motive. The State's theory was that I was angry that I had served a five-year sentence 'for' Mr. DeLeon, and Mr. DeLeon was now renouncing his allegiance to the gang. I entered the prison system as a 20 year old young man with a 3rd grade reading level and 4th grade math.
        A  book by John Eldredge called Wild at Heart opened my mind and heart even more to my troubled youth and what I was looking for. Looking back at my life has helped me to face the ugliness of my past and to open my heart to the one’s that I have hurt. I am ashamed of the person I was, but today I am proud of the man I have become. I am a man that feels remorse over my actions and poor choices. I have renounced the gang and their lifestyle. I enrolled in every class I could take and am being successful in changing myself and my thinking. I obtained my high school diploma. I have been working hard as the facility electrician and have obtained my Electrical Journeyman license and found a career in doing so!
        But my passion and biggest accomplishment is a program Jim Leffew, Lt. Don Wood, Ruben Vega, and I started called “New Freedom”. This program helps the men in prison see the pain and damage their lifestyle of gang violence and drug abuse causes to the victim’s that are here and to the one’s lost. “New Freedom” helps the men realize that violence has a lasting effect to all, not just one, and that a life lost can never be replaced.
        This program is the way I honor my victim who was and is my friend. His dream and vision lives today as he is forever “New Freedom” and together we are changing lives. This is who I am today with the love and help from men such as Jim Leffew, Lt. Don Wood, and Ruben Vega. As I continue to grow and change, I hope you will be a part of my journey to “New Freedom”.

        Meet Kyle: I once heard the expression, "We accept the love we think we deserve." This could apply to any number of dysfunctional relationship types, but in the context of gangs it is especially poignant.
        I have been in prison for over three decades and like everyone else I know who has gone through this carceral experience, I lost everything when I made those impulsive, catastrophic decisions in 1989. The devastating outcomes led to my own imprisonment and loss of worldly possessions, freedom, relationships, privacy, and personal dignity. This void was filled with the only thing available - the pseudo love of a prison gang, the camaraderie of criminals.
        My mission with New Freedom is to replace this false love with real and meaningful pro-social and positive alternatives for gang involved youth and adults alike. This epiphany has become my life's work.

        Meet Daniel: My name is Daniel Perez, I am 24 years old and was born in Yakima Washington. My environment brought gang violence and crime. When my brother passed in 2009 I decided to cope with my grief by turning towards the camaraderie of gang lifestyle and using violence as an outlet. I came to prison at the age of 15 with a 20 year sentence, I then directed my life towards transformation. I accepted my ability to connect with people and be a teacher in order to pursue my purpose in life! I am a gang/criminal interventionist with New Freedom. Through the program I assist men seeking positive change while continuing to develop my own skill set.
