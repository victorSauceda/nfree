        Meet Victor: My name is Victor Martinez. I’m currently seventeen years into a twenty-eight year sentence, twenty-five years for Washington State D.O.C and three years for Federal prison. From the age of twelve years old I have lived my life as a criminal. I was a gang member, a drug dealer and finally an addict.  That lifestyle was like living in the gutter and lying to yourself every day. Today, I strive to be a positive influence to everyone around me and create an atmosphere where I am able to encourage positive change in others.

        Meet Randy: Arriving to prison at 19 years old in 2004, I was very susceptible to social influences. I quickly became a prison gang affiliate and for the first turbulent years of my time I caused myself many hardships by living in that pit of hopelessness and misery. I am now a gang interventionist - New Freedom peer facilitator, and a hopeful, productive member of my community. It takes many moving parts to power the engines of change, and I am proud to be doing my part to help others change their criminal thinking and trade their gang culture and lifestyle for a more hopeful and promising way of being. I am from Thurston County and my current release date is 02/22/2029

        Meet Kyle: I once heard the expression, "We accept the love we think we deserve." This could apply to any number of dysfunctional relationship types, but in the context of gangs it is especially poignant.
        I have been in prison for over three decades and like everyone else I know who has gone through this carceral experience, I lost everything when I made those impulsive, catastrophic decisions in 1989. The devastating outcomes led to my own imprisonment and loss of worldly possessions, freedom, relationships, privacy, and personal dignity. This void was filled with the only thing available - the pseudo love of a prison gang, the camaraderie of criminals.
        My mission with New Freedom is to replace this false love with real and meaningful pro-social and positive alternatives for gang involved youth and adults alike. This epiphany has become my life's work.

        Meet James: My name is James Paulk. I am 42 years old and from The Dalles, Oregon. I’ve been in prison the last 14 years, most of it spent alone and hopeless. All of my life, I only saw the differences between myself and others. I now feel hopeful and united with like minded individuals from all walks of life. I am able to see the similarities now, that all humans share no matter race, religion or financial position or background. I believe in New Freedom, my team, and the people this program has and will help given the opportunity.

        Meet Daniel: My name is Daniel Perez, I am 24 years old and was born in Yakima Washington. My environment brought gang violence and crime. When my brother passed in 2009 I decided to cope with my grief by turning towards the camaraderie of gang lifestyle and using violence as an outlet. I came to prison at the age of 15 with a 20 year sentence, I then directed my life towards transformation. I accepted my ability to connect with people and be a teacher in order to pursue my purpose in life! I am a gang/criminal interventionist with New Freedom. Through the program I assist men seeking positive change while continuing to develop my own skill set.

        Meet Vu: My name is Viet Vu, I am 47 years old I’ve spent the last 33 years of my life, in and out of prison, because of gang, criminal lifestyle and bad decision. I no longer want to live that lifestyle, and have done all I can to change my life. Through New Freedom I want to help who ever I can, so that they don’t walk down the same road I've walk.

        Meet Kimothy: My story Is birthed in the familiar foster care to prison pipeline headline, another tentacle of this country's prison industrial complex. I'm from a broken home, a drug addicted mother who was in and out of jail, state and federal prison. I don't know my father. At age 14 my survival depended solely upon myself, learning everything the hard way through trial and error.

        Looking back, my joining the Hilltop Crips felt like a natural progression in my maturation leading me to eventually become a neighborhood celebrity gangster. This spin cycle led me to a lengthy prison sentence from where I write this today.

        Prison gave me a crash course in identifying my delusions of misplaced trust, fake family, fake love and fake loyalty. Coming to prison kept me alive long enough to switch lanes, self-reflect and develop a new set of core values.

        New Freedom Washington allowed me to dig deeper to better understand myself and how I view people around me, thereby allowing me to intentionally develop my own sense of purpose in life. New Freedom gave me a platform to be around like minded individuals that wanted better for themselves and wanted to change their ways and ultimately their lives. This program has been instrumental to my transformation, it gave me the opportunity to unpack some of the trauma that I've been through that led me to making some of the poor choices that I've made in my life. I'm thankful for the platform, because once I was able to release some of my struggles, delusions, faults, shortcomings, and pain... I was finally able to begin to heal. Needless to say, New freedom became my therapy.

        Being a New Freedom graduate and facilitator aided me in confidence, not only to navigate my new path towards success, but to also champion others to do the same. I've taken those attributes that were misplaced and I've applied them to legal enterprises.

        After being mentally liberated, i now truly believe that anything is possible.
        You can look me up on kimothymwynn.com to see how i am consistently "striving to be the change that I wanna see".

        Meet Joseph: Im Joseph "Broadway" Kennedy During the initial enrollment screening for the New Freedom Program I was disappointed to learn that I had not been selected. At a later date I was elated to find that I would be accepted and enrolled in the upcoming class. Part of my trepidation in this process lies in the fact that I am not STG (Security Threat Group) classified by DOC, in other words, I am not associated with a gang. My degree of skepticism surrounding my admission & acceptance once classes began proved unfounded. I say with much adulation these concerns were totally unwarrantless, these men accepted me foe who I was and there was no judgment. The curriculum allowed us to peel away the superficial layers of our exteriors, exposing our true identities. Immediately I identified with our shared criminal addictions and lifestyle choices that contributed to a path of destruction. New Freedom has offered me the space and fellowship to reflect upon changing my actions and decisions. New Freedom has offered me leadership development and experience that promotes social responsibility and self- awareness. Today I serve this LWOP sentence with dignity and integrity, what I live for is positive connection and developing meaningful relationships. I marvel in the fact that New Freedom has created a network and platform to support and serve those of us currently incarcerated, as well as our alumni who are re-entering society. This program is truly a catalyst foe community empowerment and individual success.
