        Meet Yusef: Hey! my name is Yusef. I am a founding member of New Freedom Washington. Originally, I am from Los Angeles, California and I that has something to do with me being a motivatied optimist. Currently, I'm incarcerated due to my tragic life decisions. In seeking redemption from my past actions, I have transformed my life and turned a negative situation into a positive one. Now, as a man of faith, integrity, excellence and leadership, I am dedicated to make the world a better place by being of service to others.

    #     Meet Randy :Arriving to prison at 19 years old in 2004, I was very susceptible to social influences. I quickly became a prison gang affiliate and for the first turbulent years of my time I caused myself many hardships by living in that pit of hopelessness and misery. I am now a gang interventionist - New Freedom peer facilitator, and a hopeful, productive member of my community. It takes many moving parts to power the engines of change, and I am proud to be doing my part to help others change their criminal thinking and trade their gang culture and lifestyle for a more hopeful and promising way of being. I am from Thurston County and my current release date is 02/22/2029

    #     Meet James: My name is James Paulk. I am 42 years old and from The Dalles, Oregon. I’ve been in prison the last 14 years, most of it spent alone and hopeless. All of my life, I only saw the differences between myself and others. I now feel hopeful and united with like minded individuals from all walks of life. I am able to see the similarities now, that all humans share no matter race, religion or financial position or background. I believe in New Freedom, my team, and the people this program has and will help given the opportunity.

    #     Meet Daniel: My name is Daniel Perez, I am 24 years old and was born in Yakima Washington. My environment brought gang violence and crime. When my brother passed in 2009 I decided to cope with my grief by turning towards the camaraderie of gang lifestyle and using violence as an outlet. I came to prison at the age of 15 with a 20 year sentence, I then directed my life towards transformation. I accepted my ability to connect with people and be a teacher in order to pursue my purpose in life! I am a gang/criminal interventionist with New Freedom. Through the program I assist men seeking positive change while continuing to develop my own skill set.

    #     Meet James: My name is Viet Vu, I am 47 years old I’ve spent the last 33 years of my life, in and out of prison, because of gang, criminal lifestyle and bad decision.

    #     Meet Kimothy: I will start by saying that my name is Kimothy Wynn. I'm 43 years old and am currently incarcerated at the Monroe Correctional Complex/TRU.

    #     I'm a former HillTop Crip from Tacoma Washington. I've been incarcerated since December 4th 1999 for a shooting.

    #     Now fast forward 21 years later. I am no longer a member of the Hilltop crips. I've found my independence. I've matured and am proud to say that I am a New Freedom Graduate and New Freedom Facilitator here at MCC/TRU. I am now a published author of two books. The first book is called 'Incarcerated Individuals Guide To Good Credit' by Kimothy Wynn (this one is for inmates) and talks about what incarcerated individuals can do right now to build their credit while they're still incarcerated which will help make their transition into society a lot easier. And The second book is called 'Credit Equals Cash' by Kimothy Wynn. This book explains to people in society how they can create, build and repair their credit, it also includes credit dispute letters. Both books are available now @Amazon.com. I also have a brand new company called K.M.Wynn Property Investments, LLC. I just received my business license last week so I'm just getting started.

    #     All in all, coming to prison kept me alive long enough to allow me to mature and to switch lanes. My life has purpose now. Whereas before, I was simply lost. My mission now is to do whatever I can to help other men and women get out of gangs while they still can and to help them to break away from the cycle of committing crimes. If I can do it, then anyone can do it. All they need is to have the desire to want better for themselves. What i've learned is people just need a positive example they can relate to, someone that's also relatable to them. They need resorces, and they need somebody that will help them get through the process of change every step of the way. Someone that won't give up on them if they make a mistake. That's where New Freedom Washington comes in. Change is hard and it's possible, but it doesn't happen overnight.
